# 🤝 Contributing to PresiScope

PresiScope is a sovereign, multilingual sanctuary. Contributions are welcome — but only if they honor its neutrality, clarity, and ritual of renewal.

## 🧭 Principles

- 🕊️ **Neutrality**: No partisan bias, no ideological agenda
- 🌍 **Multilingualism**: French, English, Arabic — others welcome
- 🔄 **Monthly Reset**: The app clears itself every 1st of the month
- 🔐 **Respect for Autonomy**: No tracking, no data collection
- 🧠 **Clarity**: All code must be explicit, documented, and accessible
